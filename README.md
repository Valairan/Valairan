# Full Stack developer that makes games on the side...
Here's some stuff I'm proud of
1. **Tiramisu** - Tiramisu means "Pick me up" in Italian. Here's a simplified ride-share experience built in Canada. None of the hassle, all of the convenience. - https://github.com/Valairan/Tiramisu \#firebase \#android \#ios \#java
2. **What's In My Suitcase** - Track what you pack with your family using this app. - https://github.com/Valairan/WhatsInMySuitcase \#firebase \#android \#full-stack
3. **FlatSwap** - Trying to take on the housing problem in Ontario. A small curated community for people looking to transfer their lease. Very Exclusive. - https://github.com/Valairan/FlatSwap \#react \#react-native \#mongo \#node
